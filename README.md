### Hi there <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="25px">
I am Cory Stephenson.

<br />

I graduated from Tennessee Technological University in December of 2018 with a B.S. in Manufacturing & Engineering Technology. I also earned minors in Business, Mathematics, and Computer Science. While pursuing my undergraduate degree at Tennessee Tech, I was also selected as one of ten students to take part in a Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) summer internship for two consecutive years.

In May of 2021, I graduated from Middle Tennessee State University with an M.S. in Information Systems Security & Assurance. I had my first exposure to Linux in the spring of 2019. One thing I've never really been able to do is install Arch Linux without the assistance of that Python installation script.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently developing a handful of shell scripts for Linux System Administration purposes in general.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to use VIM.
